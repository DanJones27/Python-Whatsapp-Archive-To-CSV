# Python-Whatsapp-Archive-To-CSV
Code for cleaning whatsapp archived .txt files to CSV

Whatsapp conversations are downloadable (by zip .txt file) but not formatted well for running analysis. This code breaks down strings into 'date','time','author','message' and ignores any strings that do not involve text i.e. group icon changed , group name changed, added/deleted contacts.
